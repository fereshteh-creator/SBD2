## 1. Business Plan analysis:

Digitec Galaxus is Switzerland’s largest online retailer for consumer electronics, operating exclusively via e-commerce.\
Despite nationwide reach, customer behavior likely differs across cantons due to income, urbanization, age, citizenship, and household structures.

This project explores how these demographic and regional factors influence online purchases using: - \~163’000 Digitec transaction records, and\
- Canton-level demographic data from the Swiss Federal Statistical Office (BFS).

The findings will guide a data-driven marketing strategy to personalize digital campaigns and increase online sales efficiency.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.1. Business Problem

> **How can regional demographics be used to improve Digitec’s online marketing strategy and boost conversions across Switzerland?**

Digitec currently uses uniform national marketing, but demographic diversity suggests that: - Urban cantons might favor high-end tech, - Rural areas could prefer affordable products, - Younger, single populations may show distinct category interests.

By linking demographic patterns with online purchasing data, Digitec can **target audiences more intelligently** and tailor its digital campaigns for maximum impact.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.2. Data Overview

| Source | Description | Key Variables |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:---------------------------|
| **Digitec Transactions (`DigitecLive_Final.csv`)** | \~163k web-scraped online transactions | `brandName`, `infos.Category`, `salesPrice.amountIncl`, `dateTime`, `mun_canton` |
| **BFS Population Data (`population_2023.xlsx`)** | Canton-level demographics (2023) | `Total`, `Male`, `Female`, `Swiss`, `Foreigner`, `Urban`, `Intermediate`, `Rural`, `Age_0_19`, `Age_20_64`, `Age_65plus`, `Single`, `Married`, `Widowed`, `Divorced` |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.3. Unit of Analysis

The analysis is performed at the canton level ($n = 26$), allowing integration of both datasets and ensuring consistent comparisons.

Each canton will serve as one observation with the following computed indicators: - $sales\_per\_capita = \frac{total\_sales}{population}$ - Average order value (CHF) - Shares of gender, citizenship, age, urbanization, and marital status

This approach balances detail with interpretability and enables clear visual communication.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 1.4. Methodology

#### 1.4.1. Analytical Steps

1.  **Aggregate** Digitec transactions by canton (`mun_canton`).\
2.  **Merge** with BFS data using canton names as keys.\
3.  **Compute** derived indicators:
    -   Demographic ratios: gender, foreign population, age, urbanization, marital status
    -   Economic indicators: total sales, sales per capita, average order value\
4.  **Analyze** correlations and visualize relationships using scatterplots, heatmaps, and choropleths.\
5.  **Identify** four key findings that can inform marketing decisions.

#### 1.4.2. Research Questions

| Demographic Dimension | Research Question | Usage Example (What Digitec Could Do) |
|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|:-----------------------|
| **Population Size** | Do larger cantons generate proportionally more online sales? | Allocate higher Google Ads and social-media budgets to densely populated cantons to maximize reach. |
| **Gender Composition** | Does male/female ratio affect product mix (e.g., gaming vs. home appliances)? | Adapt homepage banners or email content to match regional gender patterns in purchases. |
| **Citizenship** | Are foreign residents associated with higher online spending? | Run multilingual (DE/FR/EN) ads and feature global brands (Apple, Samsung) in foreigner-dense cantons. |
| **Urbanization** | Do urban cantons buy more premium electronics than rural ones? | Promote high-end products in cities; highlight budget or refurbished offers in rural regions. |
| **Age Structure** | Which age profile correlates with online activity? | Target younger regions with gaming and mobile ads; older regions with home-office and wellness tech. |
| **Marital Status** | Do single vs. married populations differ in purchase categories? | Offer “family bundles” or smart-home packages for married cantons; focus on personal devices for single-dominant areas. |



## 1.5. Strategic Impact

By merging **online sales data** with **BFS demographic indicators**, Digitec can: - Move from national-level campaigns to **regionally adaptive marketing**.\
- Align ad language, pricing, and products with **local audience characteristics**.\
- Strengthen relevance and **optimize ad spend efficiency**.
